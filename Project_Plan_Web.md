# Pomodoro Web App Conversion Plan

## 1. Frontend Technology Selection
- Use React (JavaScript/TypeScript) for the web frontend.
- Consider using Create React App or Vite for quick setup.
- Use a UI library (e.g., Material-UI, Ant Design, or Bootstrap) for faster, responsive design.

## 2. Project Setup
- Initialize a new React web project in a new folder (e.g., `pomodoro-web`).
  - `npx create-react-app pomodoro-web` or `npm create vite@latest pomodoro-web -- --template react`
- Set up TypeScript if desired (`--template typescript`).

## 3. API Integration
- Reuse your existing Flask backend (no changes needed if API endpoints remain the same).
- Set the API base URL in your web frontend to `http://localhost:5000` (or your backend's deployed address).

## 4. Authentication
- Implement login and registration forms.
- Store JWT tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` after login.
- Attach JWT tokens to API requests for protected endpoints.

## 5. Core Features Implementation
- **Activities Management**
  - List, create, update, and delete activities.
- **Pomodoro Timer**
  - Implement a timer UI (can use browser APIs for timing).
  - Allow users to start/end sessions and associate them with activities.
- **Analytics/Streaks**
  - Fetch and display analytics and streak data from the backend.

## 6. Routing
- Use React Router for navigation:
  - `/login`, `/register`, `/activities`, `/timer`, `/analytics`, etc.

## 7. UI/UX Enhancements
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile browsers.
- Add notifications (optional, using browser notifications API).
- Improve accessibility and user experience.

## 8. Testing
- Test all features in multiple browsers.
- Ensure API integration works as expected.
- Test authentication and protected routes.

## 9. Deployment
- Deploy the frontend to a static hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).
- Deploy the backend to a cloud server (if not already done).
- Update API base URL in production build to point to the deployed backend.

## 10. Future Enhancements
- Add PWA (Progressive Web App) support for installable experience.
- Add social/sharing features.
- Add more analytics and reporting.

**Tips:**
- Reuse as much logic as possible from your React Native app, but adapt UI components for web.
- Keep your backend unchanged unless you want to add web-specific features.
- Use environment variables for API URLs and sensitive data.
